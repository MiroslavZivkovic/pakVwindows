/*
* These macros define the naming strategy needed for a fortran77
* routine to call a C routine, and whether to build so they may be
* called from C or f77.  For the f77 call C interface, ADD_ assumes that
* f77 calls expect C routines to have an underscore postfixed to the name
* (Suns, and the Intel expect this).  NOCHANGE indicates that f77 expects
* the name called by fortran to be identical to that compiled by C
* (RS6K's do this).  UPCASE says it expects C routines called by fortran
* to be in all upcase (CRAY wants this).  The variable F77_CALL_C is always
* set to one of these values.
